# Oxide and Friends: March 17th, 2023

## On Silicon Valley Bank with Eric Vishria

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording from March 17th, 2023](https://youtu.be/pYrlCv-bwDk).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://mastodon.social/@bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://mastodon.social/@ahl),
we were joined special guests
[Eric Vishria](https://twitter.com/ericvishria) and
[Steve Tuck](https://hachyderm.io/@sdtuck).

Curated chat log from the show:

- **davidf**: Sharing this here because I loved every bit of it: [My Startup Banking Story by Mitchell Hashimoto](https://mitchellh.com/writing/my-startup-banking-story)
- **ewen**: 'The teller looks at the paper, then looks at me, then looks back at the paper, then asks ""Are you the HashiCorp guy?"" ' ðŸ˜® 
(Definitely agree that post looks relevant, and is worth reading; thanks for sharing.    There's quite the impedance mismatch between ""traditional banking"" and ""startup"" approaches to things.  Which I suspect in part explains how SVB was so widely used by startups.)"
- **antranigv**: **Question**: Are there any reasons why the US is behind in these banking things? all countries in the EU and developing countries have solved these problems decade(s) ago.
- **statuscalamitous**: my personal, barely informed take: we built this infra earlier, so we have more legacy
- **a172**: It sounds like what SVB was providing that was so rare was a kind of business as a service.
- **statuscalamitous**: my favorite "scare a developer" story: the way ACH payments work. that's right, SFTP!
- **antranigv**: I think you mean FTPS? did they move to SFTP? ðŸ˜„
- **drkamoz**: I think the opposite is also true, without the infra, Africaâ€™s been very early to adopt mobile banking https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20131217-east-africa-a-mobile-banking-hub
- **drkamoz**: Can you explain sweep funds?
- **Eric Likness - carpetbomberz.com**: 6 months of runway some place else. Not what Peter Thiel was telling people.
- **antranigv**: What was his response?
- **arjenroodselaar**: Eject! Eject!
- **ahl**: this was a fun summary: https://svbhallofshame.wordpress.com/
- **ahl**: https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2023/pr23016.html
- **antranigv**: This Venture Debt is intriguing, specially for startups who have a good background but are having a hard time... kinda? I guess?
