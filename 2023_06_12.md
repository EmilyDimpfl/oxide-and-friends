# Oxide and Friends: June 12th, 2023

## Virtualizing Time

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording from June 12th, 2023](https://youtu.be/eQR98smFYTc).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://mastodon.social/@bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://mastodon.social/@ahl),
we were joined by Oxide colleague
[Jordan Hendricks](https://twitter.com/itsajordansystm).

The (lightly edited) live chat from the show:

- **DanCrossNYC:** The TSC ticks at a fixed rate now days, regardless of voltage scaling on the CPU.
- **jbk:** just x86 doesn't provide a consistent want to determine what the rate is
- **jbk:** (I guess *some* chips will tell you via CPUID, but I've yet to actually encounter such chips)
- **jbk:** some hypervisors will tell you via an MSR
- **zorg24:** Looks the Linux kernel docs have some documentation on the x86 TSC and PIT https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/virt/kvm/x86/timekeeping.html
- **DanCrossNYC:** CPUID or an MSR, but yeah, most systems sample over a fixed interval (determined by another time source) to figure it out.
- **jbk:** no, versus some other present component that allows you to measure the frequency
- **DanCrossNYC:** No, the PIT or HPET or something.
- **jbk:** https://src.illumos.org/source/xref/illumos-gate/usr/src/uts/i86pc/os/tscc_pit.c?r=236cb9a8
- **jbk:** is how it uses the PIT
- **jbk:** (the HPET code needs to improve it's accuracy, so it's only used when the PIT isn't there at the moment)
- **jbk:** some Intel NUCs have no PIT
- **jbk:** so HPET is the only option
- **bcantrill:** https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate/commit/717646f7112314de3f464bc0b75f034f009c861e
- **DanCrossNYC:** Two big ones: system maintenance without disturbing guest workloads, and also load balancing across a rack.
- "**Sevan:** ah, thanks.
- https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate/blob/717646f7112314de3f464bc0b75f034f009c861e/usr/src/test/bhyve-tests/tests/common/common.c#L166"
- **bcantrill:** https://github.com/oxidecomputer/tsc-simulator/tree/master
- **DanCrossNYC:** The guest may well be running NTP itself.
- **iangrunert:** I assume you could also check that NTP is alive / has synced recently before doing a migration right?
- **aka_pugs:** Do people use IEEE 1588/PTP in datacenters?  Maybe finance wackos?
- **zorg24:** also it might be tricky to check if NTP synced recently if it is happening in usermode
- **iangrunert:** Might've missed this - is it just the hypervisor that has to run NTP recently or the VM as well?
- **saone:** I believe it was just the hypervisor
- **DanCrossNYC:** The host.
- **DanCrossNYC:** A guest may or may not; that's up to the guest.
- **jbk:** but IIUC, if the guest IS running NTP, then the host definitely needs it to avoid any time warps
- **DanCrossNYC:** Yup.
- **DanCrossNYC:** Fortunately, there's a bit of an out for the blackout window during migration: SMM mode can effectively pause a machine for an indefinite period of time.
- **DanCrossNYC:** We don't USE SMM anywhere, but robust systems software kinda needs to handle the case where the machine goes out to lunch for a minute.
- **zorg24:** ðŸ™Œ hooray for hardware with no SMM use
- **DanCrossNYC:** We have done everything we can to turn it off.
- **ahl:** https://github.com/dtolnay/case-studies/blob/master/autoref-specialization/README.md
- **ahl:** https://github.com/oxidecomputer/propolis
- **earltea:** it worked so well I almost thought the VM didn't migrate ðŸ˜…
- **saone:** It's easy to forget that there's a world outside the cloud, but edge deployments that have physical peripherals hooked up need to maintain those connections to peripherals; migrating those peripherals to cloud environments and managing that integration has been a big challenge for my group.
- **iangrunert:** https://signalsandthreads.com/clock-synchronization/ Good listen about clock synchronization and PTP in the ""finance weirdos"" world. MiFID 2 time sync requirements require timestamping key trading event records to within 100 microseconds of UTC.
- **jhendricks:** a bit belated, but the propolis side of these changes: https://github.com/oxidecomputer/propolis/commit/7ed480843d3b5cfd9fd07dce41772f8eac4e9171
- **saethlin:** The calvalry??
- **saethlin:** Are we just going to let that slide
- **saethlin:** Is this a pronunciation situation again
- **zorg24:** not the first time I've heard it pronounced that way ðŸ¤·
- **saethlin:** Well maybe it's me learning this time
- **DanCrossNYC:** Calvary
- **DanCrossNYC:** That's the religious thing.
- **ahl:** https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate/blob/0c5967db436935325af441af2b27d337f4e64af5/usr/src/uts/common/os/cyclic.c#L44
- **zooooooooo:** thought this was rust typescript at first ðŸ˜³
- **DanCrossNYC:** Dunno... I missed it. ðŸ™‚
- **ahl:**
```
 *  Starting in about 1994, chip architectures began specifying high resolution
 *  timestamp registers.  As of this writing (1999), all major chip families
 *  (UltraSPARC, PentiumPro, MIPS, PowerPC, Alpha) have high resolution
 *  timestamp registers, and two (UltraSPARC and MIPS) have added the capacity
 *  to interrupt based on timestamp values.  These timestamp-compare registers
 *  present a time-based interrupt source which can be reprogrammed arbitrarily
 *  often without introducing error.  Given the low cost of implementing such a
 *  timestamp-compare register (and the tangible benefit of eliminating
 *  discrete timer parts), it is reasonable to expect that future chip
 *  architectures will adopt this feature.
```
- **aka_pugs:** Bryan's TSC is overflowing.
- **DanCrossNYC:** That's Tom.
- **DanCrossNYC:** Riding in with the cavalry.
- **aka_pugs:** Good session.
- **ahl:** Thanks Jordan and everyone who joined us live; we'll make this chat read-only in just a few minutes
- **bcantrill:** Yes, thank you Jordan

Our next show will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time on our Discord
server; stay tuned to our Mastodon feeds for details, or [subscribe to this
calendar](https://sesh.fyi/api/calendar/v2/iMdFbuFRupMwuTiwvXswNU.ics).  We'd
love to have you join us, as we always love to hear from new speakers!
