# Oxide and Friends: June 19, 2023

## Software Verificationpalooza

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording from June 19th, 2023](https://youtu.be/CcYK8E1UuJY).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://mastodon.social/@bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://mastodon.social/@ahl),
we were joined by Oxide colleagues
Greg Colombo and
[Rain Paharia](https://hachyderm.io/@rain).

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [Distributed Sagas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UTOLRTwOX0)
- [Steno](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/steno) -- Oxide's implementation of distributed sagas
- [Learn TLA+](https://learntla.com/)
- [Hillel Wayne talks](https://www.hillelwayne.com/talks/)
- [Hillel Wayne on Alloy 6](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/alloy6/)
- [Quickcheck Paper](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/john-hughes/quick.pdf) (2000)
- [Proptest docs](https://altsysrq.github.io/proptest-book)
- Rain's example code
```rust
proptest::prelude::*;
use proptest::collection::vec;
proptest! {
  #[test]
  fn proptest_my_sort_pairs(input in vec(any::<u64>(), 0..128)) {
    let output = my_sort(input);
    for window in output.windows(2) {
      assert!(window[0] <= window[1]);
    }
  }

  #[test]
  fn proptest_my_sort_against_bubble_sort(input in vec(any::<u64>(), 0..128)) {
    let output = my_sort(input.clone());
    let bubble_output = bubble_sort(input);
    assert_eq!(output, bubble_output);
  }
  // These proptests implicitly check that my_sort doesn't crash.
}
```
- [buf-list crate](https://crates.io/crates/buf-list)
- [guppy crate](https://crates.io/crates/guppy)
- ... and stay tuned for an upcoming episode [revisiting](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/oxide-and-friends/blob/master/2022_09_12.md) `async`/`await` in Rust
