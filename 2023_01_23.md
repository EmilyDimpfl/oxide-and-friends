# Oxide and Friends: January 23rd, 2023

## Revisiting Unikernels

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording from January 23rd, 2023](https://youtu.be/2WLhwgBH-cg).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://mastodon.social/@bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://mastodon.social/@ahl),
speakers on January 23rd included
[Steve Klabnik](https://twitter.com/steveklabnik),
[Dan Cross](https://discuss.systems/@cross).
and [YY]().
(Did we miss your name and/or get it wrong? Drop a PR!)

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- Bryan's 2016 blog post [Unikernels are unfit for production](http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2016/01/22/unikernels-are-unfit-for-production/)
- [Topic](link)
- [@M:SS](link into recording)
  *Leventhal's Conundrum*
- PRs needed!

If we got something wrong or missed something, please file a PR!
Our next show will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time on our Discord
server; stay tuned to our Mastodon feeds for details, or [subscribe to this
